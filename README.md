### Data Files
2017 Data and 2018 Data and dummy data that stores a summarised financial statement, and these data will be read into the R code and churn out a M-score. This M-score is the result of Beneish Model, where if the score is less than -1.78, means the company is less likely to be a manipulator, and hence otherwise.

###Possible future improvements
Read in more excel files in an automated way and perhaps use loose values from the financial statement instead of summarised ones.
